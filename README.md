# Install Spring Cloud Data Flow in IBM Cloud

## Pre-requisites

You must have an account created in IBM Cloud. The account needs to be either be *Pay-As-You-Go* or *Subscription*. Click [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts "here") to read more.
If you have a Lite account, you can upgrade it. Click [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#account-gs-upgrade "here") to learn how to upgrade.

## Step 1: Provision Kubernetes Cluster

* Click on the search section at the top of the main page, type Kubernetes, and then choose Kubernetes Service.

We'll choose the Standard Plan for this documentation as the Free Plan may fall short in resources when deploying your pods. We highly recommend using a Standard Plan with the hardware that suits you the best. If you're selecting the Standard Plan, please make sure you select the adequate requirements,

* Select your Kubernetes Version to be the latest available or the required one by your application. In this example, we have set it to be '1.18.13'.
* Select Infrastructure as 'Classic'.
* Leave Resource Group to 'Default'.
* Select Geography to the one that suits you better or that fits your infrastructure.
* Select Availability to be 'Single Zone' or 'Multi Zone' depending on your needs.
* Select a Worker Zone that suits you better or that fits your infrastructure.

* Once you have installed the terminal, click on the action button again, select web terminal, and type the following command. It will show you the workspaces of your cluster. You can see *spring-example* is now active.

`$ kubectl get ns`

* You can then obtain more data about the service and it's pods. You can now use the External IP and its port to call the TensowFlow Resnet model in your own application.

`$ kubectl get pod -n NAMESERVICE -o wide`

`$ kubectl get service -n NAME SERVICE`

* Select the pod within your service using bash if you want to use the files or change any configuration of the TensorFlow installation.

`$ kubectl exec --stdin --tty PODNAME -n NAMESPACE -- /bin/bash`
